# Who Survived the Titanic? A Predictive Model Based on Passenger Characteristics
The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, resulting in the deaths of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Despite the element of luck involved in survival, it appears that certain groups of passengers were more likely to survive than others. This project aims to build a predictive model using Naive Bayes classifier to identify the characteristics and attributes that contributed to higher chances of survival. By analyzing passenger data including variables such as age, gender, socio-economic class, family size, and port of embarkation â€” the project seeks to answer the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?" This analysis not only provides insights into the factors influencing survival but also demonstrates the application of data science techniques in historical event analysis.
